Welcome to my "Title Case" application !!!

On a general note, the purpose of this application is to convert a text entered by the user 
based on some exceptional words.
 
When a user entered a series of characters, after he clicked on "Convert" button, he can see
the converted list of characters as a message bellow.
He can also reset the input by pressing the "Clear" button.

For this project I used HTML5, CSS3 and JS ES6 in order to implement the input, the message and
the buttons as well.

I used "event delegation" technique which is popular in JS ES6.

Check out the custom favicon ðŸ˜‰

Hope you enjoy !!!
